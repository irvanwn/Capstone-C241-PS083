## Backend - CLoud Computing
Designing and Planning Architecture, Designing Rest API and Deploying through Cloud Run for endpoint communication with Mobile Android Application through Google Cloud Platform. Database was created in Firestore and deployed with App Engine. Machine Learning model API is  deployed at Google Compute engine.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js     : Javascript Runtime, we use to create API
- Firebase    : NoSQL database of Google Cloud Platform, is suitable for web/mobile application database login and suitable for login authentication. we use this as a Database for login
- App Engine  : Google's cloud platform for building and running web/mobile apps without the hassle of servers. We use this for Backend API express deployment for Login
- Python      : Programming Language we use for Image Analysis API
- Google Compute Engine : Virtual Machines (VMs) on Google Cloud Platform, we use it for Machine Learning API Deployment

### Important Notes
- file key.json at keys Folder was unuploaded because safety issue, to replicate the code you can get you service account key and download it on your local computer
- for Machine Learning API Flask deployment, you need to create virtual environment inside VM, you can follow steps on note.txt inside Machine Learning API Flask deployment folder
